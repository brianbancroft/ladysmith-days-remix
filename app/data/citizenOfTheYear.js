      Kathy Holmes is well-known around the arts community. Over  many years, she has spent countless hours promoting the arts for Ladysmith, ensuring the continuation of many programs as well as raising funds for supplies to support young artists. A highlight in her service was leading the arts council from its own waterfront gallery to a temporary home at the old Davis Rd school when circumstances required them to vacate, and then finding a new home downtown at the corner of 1st and High St where the works of local artists can now be seen by many.

These include the Kinsmen, the Show and Shine, the Forest Wardens, the Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue (back when it was under a different name), as well as multiple tours as a coach for softball and soccer.
